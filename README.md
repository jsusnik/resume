### IRIS POWER

Junior Engineer · 2012 to 2018 · Mississauga, Ontario
Automated the calibration process of instruments using Python, Oscilloscopes, and Excel. I was the principal developer of an IoT
application for a single board computer, which also worked on a RaspberryPi device. I designed an Android phone application
(Xamarin, Microsoft Visual Studio) which communicated with an Azure Cloud repository (Blob) while accessing secure customer
data. I developed complex algorithms to simulate instrument diagnostics as a prototype, which was then used as a production
model.
